        content: 'Mohammad Reza’s paper “GlitchBench: Can large multimodal models detect video game glitches?” was accepted for publication at the CVPR 2024 conference! Super congrats Mohammad Reza and co-author Tianjun! This was a collaboration with Dr. Anh Nguyen from Auburn University. Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have evolved from large language models (LLMs) to integrate multiple input modalities, such as visual inputs. This integration augments the capacity of LLMs for tasks requiring visual comprehension and reasoning. However, the extent and limitations of their enhanced abilities are not fully understood, especially when it comes to real-world tasks. ',
